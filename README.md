Flips guitar tabs upside down

This script takes a .txt guitar tab and turns the strings upside down (EADGBE -> EBGDAE, for example).
It will ask for the file name and the number of line breaks between strings(when I copy-pasted the ultimate-guitar tab I wanted to flip it turned out to be 2 - one for the first line break, and another empty line). The result will be "output.txt".
